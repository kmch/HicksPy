HicksPy: distributed sources in FD
==================================

Getting started
---------------
The best way to start is to play around with example notebooks
in `examples/`.

Key features
------------
Calculating coefficients of Hicks sources / receivers.



Requirements
------------
Remember to add parent-path/fullwavepy to your PYTHONPATH.
(parent-path is not enough since we have:
parent-path/fullwavepy/fullwavepy/__init__.py).
